Banner Flags 🏳️

Ever since banners were added I've wanted to place them horizontally like flags. Now I have made it possible using this data pack!

🚩FEATURES:

Place flag in 4 directions

Displays the banner you actually placed

Break the block it is placed on to remove it and get your banner back

Place multiple on the same block!

Works on multiplayer & survival friendly!

Make bigger flags

⛳SUPPORTED BLOCKS:

fences

walls

glass panes

iron bars

lightning rod

chain

### 🤔HOW TO USE:
Crouch + click a banner on one of the supported blocks to place your banner as a flag! Break the block it is placed on to remove it.

Crouch near or on top of the flag pole while holding a diamond to make your flag bigger! You get your diamond back when breaking the flag.

❌UNINSTALLATION:
If you don't end up liking the pack here are the ways you can remove the flags:

manually breaking each block that a flag has been placed on so you get the banners back. or
writing /function bannerflags:removeall (you wont get your banners back though)
❕SUMMARY:
This datapack greatly expands the ways you can use banners in Minecraft, such as for decoration, storytelling & direction pointers.
